//! # The Key Exchange Protocol
//!
//! This crate implements a key exchange protocol with 3 parties, namely server,
//! leader and follower. The goal is to end up with a shared secret (ECDH)
//! between the server and the client. The client in this context is leader and
//! follower combined, which means that each of them will end up with a share of
//! the shared secret. The leader will do all the necessary communication
//! with the server alone and forward all messages from and to the follower.
//!
//! A detailed description of this protocol can be found in our documentation
//! <https://docs.tlsnotary.org/protocol/notarization/key_exchange.html>.
